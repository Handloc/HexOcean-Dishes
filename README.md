# HexOcean - Recruitment Task - Junior Frontend Developer

### About

This project was made in about 7 hours - including time for learning about React Hook Form.
It was my first time using this library, so I am aware that it may not be perfect, but still - I'm pretty happy, because I've learned something new and now I see how cumbersome is dealing with forms in React without using any library.
